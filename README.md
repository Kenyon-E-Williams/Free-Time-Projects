Thank you for coming to check out some of the exploratory data analysis that I have completed in my free time. Often times I draw on interest from current news and my overall curiousity to refine my search for datasets to explore. I mainly call upon the Pandas, Numpy, and MatPlot packages to carry out my exploration of the datasets that I find. When I cannot find the data that I am looking for in a formal CSV file, I have developed the skills necessary to code webscrapers to craft my own datase that I can subsequently explore.I hope you enjoy!
